# Scala Delegating Constructor Issue

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with delegating constructors in Scala. When a class has a primary constructor and a delegating constructor, the default value provided to the delegating constructor can lead to unexpected results. The example `MyClass` shows a scenario where the default value of `x` is 0 in the delegating constructor and not updated when you create an instance of `MyClass` with no parameter, therefore returning 0 even when using new MyClass(). This scenario is very easy to miss unless you are very careful and always verify values in your code. This may lead to unexpected results, especially if the default value is not carefully set or assumed to always be updated correctly. This is a common error when working with delegating constructors and may require more verbose logging or defensive programming to handle such circumstances.
